We know, in our community, that as elected leaders we stand on the shoulders of those who have come before us. JP Morrell, who he is, is what our civil rights leaders fought for during the movement.
 

 A Black leader who would lead the fight to end 138 years of Jim Crow. A leader who would work tirelessly to overthrow a legacy of the confederacy meant to disenfranchise our community. A leader who uses his exceptional legal skills to challenge the status quo on behalf of the people and win. 
 

 JP is a legal scholar who led the fight to change laws in our justice system so Black children charged with a crime are not automatically tried as adults, ending their lives before they began. 
 

 A skilled coalition builder, who led the most powerful committee in the Louisiana Senate – yes, our ancestors would be proud of JP Morrell. 
 

 I know JP. I've known him since he was a student at McDonogh 15. I've watched him since he was a Public Defender on Tulane and Broad, fighting for those in our community without a voice. I served with him as a member of the Legislative Black Caucus where he always tackled problems like he was running out of time, where he stared down powerful forces in this state that did not want change.
 

 When our civil rights leaders marched for the right to vote, it was because they wanted us to one day elect leaders like JP Morrell who has the audacity to believe that the people should have the power and that government should work for all the people. 
 Now more than ever we need strong leaders in New Orleans. That’s why I’m supporting JP Morrell - an exceptional leader , as our next Councilmember for Division 2."" - Rep. Troy A Carter

854305408417889.0,"If serving in Special Forces taught me anything about home security, it's that relying on my firearm is more risk than I'm willing to take.
 

 In the Army, we train for all kind of worst-case scenarios. Every mission has multiple weaknesses, and we have separate plans for what to do when one of those weaknesses is exposed.
 

 Plans for operating a vehicle if the driver is injured.
 

 Plans for moving a vehicle if it's disabled.
 

 Plans for reacting if someone is wounded. Or two people. Or three.
 

 The point is - we train for every contingency we can think of, and we do it until it's second-nature.
 

 The reason is simple - the difference between a crisis and a disaster is preparation.
 

 We can't control everything that happens on the battlefield, but we can control how prepared we are, and what we do next.
 

 If we're unprepared - that could be the difference between life or death.
 

 And at the heart of every mission is one goal - minimize the loss of life.
 

 When I left the military, I applied the same training to how I protect my family and our home.
 

 I realized that I needed some kind of ""early warning system"" - something that would tell me when my home was in danger if I wasn't around.
 

 So my wife and I installed an alarm system.
 

 But after a few months with an alarm, I started feeling uneasy about how I was protecting my family.
 

 I had done enough research to know that the average police response time to a break-in could be 20 minutes or more.
 

 So while I felt better knowing that the alarm would notify police for me, it didn't actually protect my family.
 

 Think about it - by the time the alarm is going off, the intruder is already inside, and A LOT can happen in 20 minutes.
 

 Heck - the average break-in only lasts 10 minutes.
 

 And for me, the alarm means I'm now in a life-or-death fight to protect my family.
 

 As the only line of defense, if something happens to me, my wife and children are left unprotected.
 

 Even as well-trained as I am (and I'm lethal with a weapon), I knew that I couldn't control every variable.
 

 I'd have just seconds to wake up to the sound of a break-in, get to my weapon, and face the intruder. 
 

 All while ensuring that my wife and kids stay out of harm's way.
 

 What if they get a shot off first?
 

 What if there's 5 of them? 10?
 

 What if they came in the exterior door to my bedroom?
 

 In that case, I'd be in a life-or-death fight before the alarm even went off.
 

 What if my weapon jammed?
 

 Even with all my training, I'd have just seconds to fix my weapon in pitch black, having just been jolted awake in the dead of night.
 

 It quickly became obvious that my home alarm system wasn't enough, and I knew I had to do more to protect my home, and family.
 

 I knew that responding to a break-in wasn't enough - I needed to prevent it.
 

 So after some searching, I discovered Door Armor.
 

 Door Armor is a multi-piece kit that reinforces the weak points in the door and frame.
 

 Most burglars enter a home through the front door, and standard doors are weak in predictable places.
 

 Door Armor adds a rigid piece of steel to these vulnerable points, which prevents the door from breaking under brute force.
 

 This was exactly the kind of prevention I was looking for.
 

 Now, if someone TRIED to break-in, I'd be alerted by the sound, and have the time necessary to secure my family and respond to the intrusion...
 

 ...that is - IF they're able to get through the door.
 

 There were several similar brands online, but personally - I liked that Door Armor had been featured on shows like Today, Fox News, and The Early Show.
 

 Not only that but they've been around since 2004, and have thousands of great reviews.
 

 They're even sold in stores like Home Depot, Lowe's, and Menard's - so I knew I wasn't buying some cheap, made-in-China knockoff.
 

 For just $99, I bought the Pro Max Plus Kit, which reinforces the 4 main weak points on my door.
 

 Once I got one and installed it, and my wife didn't hate how it looked, I bought one for every exterior door.
 

 Even after reinforcing all 4 doors, I still paid less than I'll pay for my alarm system this year, and the kits will probably last longer than the house!
 

 Needless to say, I don't worry about reacting to a home invasion anymore - I've prevented it.
 

 And even if that worst-case scenario comes, I know I'll have the time I need to protect my family, and deal with the threat.
 

 If you like the idea of fighting for your life, and really want to test your handgun skills in a true, life-or-death scenario - more power to you.
 

 As for me, when my family is in on the line, the best conflicts are the ones I can avoid (or prevent!)

 Todd: Hello… Operator…listen to me…I can’t speak very loud. – This is an emergency. I’m a passenger on a United flight to San Francisco.. We have a situation here….Our plane has been hijacked…..can you understand me?
 

 Lisa: (exhaling a deep breath to herself) I understand… Can the hijackers see you talking on the phone?
 

 Todd: No
 

 Lisa: Can you tell me how many hijackers are on the plane?
 

 Todd: There are three that we know of.
 

 Lisa: Can you see any weapons? What kind of weapons do they have?
 

 Todd: Yes…. they don’t have guns….they have knives – they took over the plane with knives.
 

 Lisa: Do you mean…like steak knives?
 

 Todd: No, these are razor knives…like box cutters.
 

 Lisa: Can you tell what country these people are from?
 

 Todd: No…..I don’t know. They sound like they’re from the mid-east.
 

 Lisa: Have they said what they want?
 

 Todd: Someone announced from the cockpit that there was a bomb on board. He said he was the captain and to stay in our seats and stay quiet.
 He said that they were meeting these men’s demands and returning to the airport… It was very broken English, and… I’m telling you…it sounded fake!
 

 Lisa: Ok sir, please give me your name.
 

 Todd: My name is Todd Beamer.
 

 Lisa: Ok Todd….my name is Lisa…Do you know your flight number? If you can’t remember, it’s on your ticket.
 

 Todd: It’s United Flight 93.
 

 Lisa: Now Todd, can you try to tell me exactly what happened?
 

 Todd: Two of the hijackers were sitting in first class near the cockpit. A third one was sitting near the back of the coach section. The two up. front got into the cockpit somehow; there was shouting. The third hijacker said he had a bomb. It looks like a bomb. He’s got it tied to his waist with a red belt of some kind.
 

 Lisa: So is the door to the cockpit open?
 

 Todd: No, the hijackers shut it behind them.
 

 Lisa: Has anyone been injured?
 

 Todd: Yes, ..they…they killed one passenger sitting in first class. There’s been lots of shouting. We don’t know if the pilots are dead or alive. A flight attendant told me that the pilot and copilot had been forced from the cockpit and may have been wounded.
 

 Lisa: Where is the 3rd hijacker now Todd?
 

 Todd: He’s near the back of the plane. They forced most of the passengers into first class. There are fourteen of us here in the back. Five are flight attendants. He hasn’t noticed that I slipped into this pantry to get the phone. The guy with the bomb ordered us to sit on the floor in the rear of the plane……….oh Jesus.. Help!
 

 Lisa: Todd….are you ok? Tell me what’s happening!
 

 Todd: Hello…..We’re going down….I think we’re going to crash……Wait – wait a minute. No, we’re leveling off….we’re ok. I think we may be turning around…..That’s it – we changed directions. Do you hear me….we’re flying east again.
 

 Lisa: Ok Todd…. What’s going on with the other passengers?
 

 Todd: Everyone is… really scared. A few passengers with cell phones have made calls to relatives. A guy, Jeremy, was talking to his wife just before the hijacking started. She told him that hijackers had crashed two planes into the World Trade Center……Lisa is that true??
 

 Lisa: Todd…..I have to tell you the truth…..it’s very bad. The World Trade Center is gone. Both of the towers have been destroyed.
 

 Todd: Oh God —help us!
 

 Lisa: A third plane was taken over by terrorists. It crashed into the Pentagon in Washington DC. Our country is under attack….and I’m afraid that your plane may be part of their plan.
 

 Todd: Oh dear God. Dear God…….Lisa, will you do something for me?
 

 Lisa: I’ll try….if I can….Yes.
 

 Todd: I want you to call my wife and my kids for me and tell them what’s happened. Promise me you’ll call..
 

 Lisa: I promise – I’ll call.
 

 Todd: Our home number is 201 353-1073…….You have the same name as my wife…Lisa….We’ve been married for 10 years. She’s pregnant with our 3rd child. Tell her that I love her…….(choking up)..I’ll always love her..(clearing throat) We have two boys.. David, he’s 3 and Andrew, he’s 1…..Tell them……(choking) tell them that their daddy loves them and that he is so proud of them. (clearing throat again) Our baby is due January 12th…..I saw an ultra sound…..it was great….we still don’t know if it’s a girl or a boy………Lisa?
 

 Lisa: (barely able to speak) I’ll tell them, I promise Todd.
 

 Todd: I’m going back to the group—if I can get back I will…
 

 Lisa: Todd, leave this line open…are you still there?……
 

 Lisa: (dials the phone..) Hello, FBI, my name is Lisa Jefferson, I’m a telephone supervisor for GTE. I need to report a terrorist hijacking of a United Airlines Flight 93….Yes I’ll hold.
 

 Goodwin: Hello, this is Agent Goodwin.. I understand you have a hijacking situation?
 

 Lisa: Yes sir, I’ve been talking with a passenger, a Todd Beamer, on Flight 93 who managed to get to an air phone unnoticed.
 

 Goodwin: Where did this flight originate, and what was its destination?
 

 Lisa: The flight left Newark New Jersey at 8 A.M. departing for San Francisco. The hijackers took over the plane shortly after takeoff, and several minutes later the plane changed course – it is now flying east.
 

 Goodwin: Ms. Jefferson…I need to talk to someone aboard that plane. Can you get me thru to the planes phone?
 

 Lisa: I still have that line open sir, I can patch you through on a conference call…hold a mo…..
 

 Todd: Hello Lisa, Lisa are you there?
 

 Lisa: Yes, I’m here. Todd, I made a call to the FBI, Agent Goodwin is on the line and will be talking to you as well.
 

 Todd: The others all know that this isn’t your normal hijacking. Jeremy called his wife again on his cell phone. She told him more about the World Trade Center and all.
 

 Goodwin: Hello Todd. This is Agent Goodwin with the FBI. We have been monitoring your flight. Your plane is on a course for Washington, DC. These terrorists sent two planes into the World Trade Center and one plane into the Pentagon. Our best guess is that they plan to fly your plane into either the White House or the United States Capital Building.
 

 Todd: I understand…hold on……I’ll…….I’ll be back..
 

 Lisa: Mr. Goodwin, how much time do they have before they get to Washington?
 

 Goodwin: Not long ma’am. They changed course over Cleveland; they’re approaching Pittsburgh now. Washington may be twenty minutes away.
 

 Todd: (breathing a little heavier) The plane seems to be changing directions just a little. It’s getting pretty rough up here. The plane is flying real erratic….We’re not going to make it out of here. Listen to me….I want you to hear this….I have talked with the others….we have decided we would not be pawns in these hijackers suicidal plot.
 

 Lisa: Todd, what are you going to do?
 

 Todd: We’ve hatched a plan. Four of us are going to rush the hijacker with the bomb. After we take him out, we’ll break into the cockpit. A stewardess is getting some boiling water to throw on the hijackers at the controls. We’ll get them….and we’ll take them out. Lisa, …..will you do one last thing for me?
 

 Lisa: Yes…What is it?
 

 Todd: Would you pray with me?
 

 They pray: Our father which art in Heaven
 

 Hallowed be thy name,
 

 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
 

 on earth as it is in heaven.
 

 Give us this day our daily bread,
 

 And forgive us our trespasses
 

 As we forgive our trespassers,
 

 And lead us not into temptation
 

 But deliver us from evil
 

 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory
 

 Forever…..Amen
 

 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want…
 

 He makes me to lie down in green pastures
 

 He leads me beside the still waters
 

 He restores my soul
 

 He leads me in paths of righteousness
 

 for His name’s sake
 

 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
 

 I will fear no evil, for thou art with me…..
 

 Todd: (softer) God help me…Jesus help me….(clears throat and louder)

 What is the goal of the pro-life movement? Is it to save babies? Change minds? Regulate abortion? Or is the goal outlawing abortion? 
 

 On today’s episode, Mark will look at the political realities to assess the current state of the battle. He will analyze the three possible responses to the moral and cultural revolution and what it will take to end abortion. 
 

 Here are the 3 possible responses: 
 

  1. We can be idealistic and naïve. 
  2. We can be pessimistic and cynical. 
  3. We can take a sober assessment and plan accordingly.
 

 We must be a people with a long-term vision for victory. Like the men of Issachar who “Understood the times and knew what Israel should do.”
 

 Our mission cannot by dependent on the ever-changing political winds. We need to raise up the next generation of leaders to take on the culture of death and win because winning is how the killing stops.

 Cancel culture is alive and well! 
 

 Recently, LifeSiteNews was permanently de-platformed by pro-abortion and LGBT groups (GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign, and NARAL Pro-Choice America) for “false information about COVID-19 that could contribute to physical harm.” Facebook also said that they de-platform Facebook pages that publish “vaccine discouraging information on the platform.”
 

 Big Abortion and Big Tech are colluding to censor pro-lifers, using the well-researched information about coronavirus vaccines as a pretext.
 

 The fact is sexual revolutionaries are leading the charge in censoring pro-life speech. In this episode, Mark discusses how pro-life advocates are undermining our efforts to change culture by welcoming our enemies inside the gates.
 

 Some of the questions that will be answered are:
  • How should we respond? 
  • Should pro-life groups create alliances with pro-LGBT groups and individuals to fight abortion? 
  • What about Francis Schaeffer’s notion of co-belligerency? 
  • How far should we go in developing joint efforts to fight abortion? 
 

 Please watch, listen, and share!

 Only one publicly-supported nonprofit in the world conducts Antarctic research by monitoring the entire Antarctic Peninsula region – Oceanites – and we have been doing this for more than two decades. Join us as we stand with the penguins.
 

 We help educate children worldwide using Penguins as avatars to explain the impact of climate change as well as the science of climate adaptation. Help us stand for the future of Antarctica and our planet.

595942248180046.0,"Top Five Astro-Events for January
 

 1. Mercury turns retrograde in Aquarius on the 14th while squaring Uranus. Challenging Mercury-Uranus aspects can bring plenty of anxiety, nervousness, and uncertainty due to developments happening beyond one’s control. That makes the three days around this Mercury station a good time to be extra cautious in your dealing with others, on the road, and wherever slip-ups could happen. Stay focused on what you’re doing to avoid accidents. For some, this station may involve the need for immediate attention to finances, like paying essential bills, or scaling back extravagant expenditures. For many, Mercury’s station will likely bring an unexpected change of plans. 
 

 2. The Full Moon in Cancer takes place on the 17th (6:48 pm EST). This lunation promises to be a powerful, disruptive phase since the Sun in Capricorn conjoins Pluto as Mercury turns retrograde. Expect business alliances, market forecasts, and legal arrangements to shift, even dramatically reverse course. Financial plans within marriages or other committed relationships may need re-working. This Full Moon also aligns with the US Pluto: look for the political scene in Washington to bring extra intense discussions, breakthroughs, and breakdowns, likely concerning a scaled-down version of Biden’s social spending and climate package. Those with planets at 26º-27º of the cardinal signs will likely be going through life-changing developments. 
 

 3. Ceres conjoins the North Node in Taurus on the 24th and is an important influence for the entire month. Since the perpetually retrograde motion of the North Node recently led to its exit from Gemini, this conjunction with Ceres anchors the North Node’s passage in Taurus for the next 18 months, creating a new interest in long-term stability. Ceres here fosters traditional family values, financial security, and whatever needs to be done for one generation to take care of its older or younger generation. In its more universal caretaking function, Ceres in Taurus awakens renewed interest in dealing with global warming. Expect some extreme weather events this month to spark concerns.
 

 4. Neptune squares Black Moon Lilith on the 25th but this mystical combination is in effect from the 14th into the first week of February. Both these archetypes are more concerned about what lies in the invisible realms than our material universe, so their blending creates a synergistic, almost tangible feeling about what’s happening behind the scenes. On the negative side, Lilith square Neptune can foment deception, conspiracy theories, mental illness, and endless fear of the unknown. On the positive side, these two enhance empathy, artistic creativity, and a questing drive for spiritual understanding. Listen to your dreams, explore the deeper dimensions of astrology. 
 

 5. Venus turns direct on the 29th while trine Uranus, an unusually pleasant and practical turning point that can bring some light into your world. After 40 days of retrograding through Capricorn, Venus has likely pushed you to question your personal relationships in some fundamental way. At the very least, you may have withdrawn to turn inward. Now, as Venus turns direct, is a good time to make decisions and begin moving forward with your new attitude of acceptance and common goals. The last three days of January are exceptionally favorable for creating practical business plans and financial arrangements. You may have to make some adjustments since Mercury is still retrograde.

 Esther lives in Kenya. In 2019 her women’s group participated in WEA’s Women and Climate Training Program and learned they have the power to transform the climate crisis.
 

 With the help of WEA, and our generous supporters, Esther’s group launched a native tree growing campaign and is training community members how to grow and manage trees on their land so that they can protect their native forests. Together, the group has grown more than 15,000 trees and protected 20 acres of forest!

290736099636252.0,"🚨President Biden's Build Back Better Act has PASSED the House!
 

 I am overjoyed to have voted to pass this monumental legislation, which will cut taxes for working families, reduce household costs and make critical investments in clean energy, child care, paid leave and so much more. And as confirmed by the Congressional Budget Office just yesterday, this once-in-a-generation legislation is 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝘂𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝘆 $𝟭𝟮𝟳 𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.
 

 From negotiating lower drug costs for seniors to providing universal pre-school for all 3- and 4-year olds, the Build Back Better Act will deliver real, lasting change to Americans of all ages in every community. With its passage in the House, we are one step closer to slashing families’ child care costs by extending the Child Tax Credit, expanding access to affordable home care for older adults and those with disabilities and reducing health care premiums for more than 9 million Americans. And by making big corporations and the wealthiest pay their fair share, not a single American making under $400,000 will pay a penny more in taxes.
 

 On top of all of this, the Build Back Better Act invests more than $550 billion to deliver the largest effort to combat climate change in American history. By cutting pollution, reducing energy costs and creating new good-paying jobs through this bill, we are finally ensuring America leads the world in creating a 21st Century clean energy economy.

644816906937705.0,"We get asked frequently how to dispose of our plant-based tea bag wrappers when you don't have access to commercial composting. The best place for these wrappers is the trash, not the recycling bin (the material can be hard for recyclers to handle). You can also try throwing them in your own backyard compost, though we can't vouch for the quality of your pile. 
 

 Ending up in the garbage is not ideal, but there are still major benefits to these plant-based materials: 
 ✅ They produce 67% less greenhouse gas emissions than conventional wrappers
 ✅ They're made from renewable resources like sugarcane and eucalyptus, which helps us transition away from fossil fuels
 ✅ They produce no eco-toxicity when they break down
 

 Although we'd love to see ALL our wrappers composted, the truth is that only around 5% of U.S. households have municipal composting services. Composting programs are an essential tool in the fight against climate change. They also reduce food waste, replenish soil, and boost food production.

 That’s how much Congress voted to spend on the Pentagon’s already bloated budget this year — all while some claim we do not have the money for child care, health care, and climate action. It is completely upside-down that our Democratic majority would approve more in military spending than Donald Trump’s last Pentagon budget. 
 

 I voted against this excessive spending because it’s a giveaway to defense contractors and giant corporations, all while millions of people in this country have to struggle without health care, affordable housing, and fully funded schools. 
 

 Part of undoing the cruel damage from the Trump administration is spending our federal dollars on taking on climate change, strengthening the social safety net, and expanding health care. Congress should not be wasting money on military bloat. I won’t stop fighting to invest in working people, families, and our communities — and I need you in this fight with me.

364770145457977.0,"Joe Manchin’s declaration that he would vote “no” on the Build Back Better Act is a betrayal of the millions of voters who elected Democrats to pass popular policies like universal pre-K, paid leave, affordable child care, fighting climate change, Medicare expansion, affordable housing, lower prescription drug costs, and more.
 

 This fight is NOT over. We’re going to keep pushing for Build Back Better and the popular policies in this bill. But the fact that one senator can tank President Biden’s necessary agenda shows that we must work to expand progressive power in the House and the Senate.
